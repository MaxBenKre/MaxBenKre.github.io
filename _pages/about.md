Hi! I am a PhD Student at the University of Mannheim at the [Chair for Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/) supervised by Markus Strohmaier.

I work with Large Language Models in the computational social sciences with a focus on predicting public decision making and synthetic data.
